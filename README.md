## PRODUCT FEATURES

The user will click on the survey button which will then direct the user to a new page with a survey to complete. The user will be required to enter in a name and a picture and will then have 10 questions to answer. The questions will have an answer from 1 to 5, 1 being strongly disagree and 5 being strongly agree. Once the user has completed the survey they will hit the submit button and a modal will appear with the name of their most compatable friend and a picture of that person. The user will then be listed in the friends API along with their responses and picture so that they can be a choice for a friend of a future user.
